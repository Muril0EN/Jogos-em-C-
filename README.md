# Eye-Tracking Pong Game

## Overview
This project is a modern twist on the classic Pong game, designed for mobile platforms (Android and iOS). The game uses eye-tracking technology to control the paddles, allowing players to move the paddle by simply looking at the screen. The project is built using C++, with a focus on performance and real-time responsiveness.

## Features
- **Eye-Tracking Control**: The paddle in the Pong game is controlled by tracking the player's eye movements using the device's camera.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: The game is designed to run on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Utilizes C++ for high-performance game logic and OpenCV for efficient eye-tracking.
- **Custom Game Engine**: Built with Cocos2d-x for 2D game rendering or Unreal Engine for advanced graphics and physics.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core language for game logic and performance optimization.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks, specifically eye-tracking.
- **Dlib**: Optional library for advanced facial feature detection and eye-tracking.
- **Cocos2d-x**: Game engine for 2D rendering (alternative to Unreal Engine).
- **Unreal Engine**: Game engine for more advanced graphics (alternative to Cocos2d-x).
- **Android NDK**: For building the Android version of the game using C++.
- **Objective-C++**: For integrating C++ with iOS native development in Xcode.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Android**: Android Studio with NDK installed.
- **iOS**: Xcode with Objective-C++ support.
- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a compatible C++ compiler installed.
- **OpenCV**: Install OpenCV for your development environment.
- **Dlib** (Optional): Install Dlib if you choose to use it for facial feature detection.
