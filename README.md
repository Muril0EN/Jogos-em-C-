# Guessing Game

## Overview
This project is a simple number guessing game developed during an introductory C++ course. The game challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. The player receives feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The goal is to guess the correct number in the fewest attempts possible.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a random number within a predefined range at the start of each game.
- **Player Feedback**: After each guess, the player is informed if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Guess Counter**: The game keeps track of the number of attempts the player makes to guess the correct number.
- **Replay Option**: After guessing the correct number, the player has the option to play again.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: The game is entirely developed in C++ as part of an introductory course to the language.
- **Standard Library**: Utilizes the C++ Standard Library for random number generation, input/output, and basic game logic.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: A working C++ compiler (such as g++, clang++, or MSVC) is required to compile the game.
- **Command Line Interface**: The game is run from the command line, so a terminal or command prompt is needed.

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/guessing-game.git
